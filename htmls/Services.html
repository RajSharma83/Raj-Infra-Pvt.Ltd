          duplexes or apartment buildings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Condominiums: Individual ownership of units within a larger building,
          with shared common areas
        </li>

        <h4>3.Mixed-Use Developments:</h4>
        <br />
        <li>
          These properties combine residential, commercial, and sometimes

        <h4>4.Land Development:</h4>
        <br />
        <li>
          This involves the transformation of raw land into a developed property
          ready for construction, whether residential, commercial, or
          industrial. This includes infrastructure such as roads, utilities, and
          drainage.
        </li>
        <br />
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
          Property building is a complex, multi-step process that requires
          careful planning, execution, and management. Whether it's a
          residential home or a large commercial development, it involves a
          combination of design, finance, construction, and legal
          considerations. Successful property building creates a valuable asset,
          but it requires coordination of many factors to ensure it is completed
          on time, within budget, and meets all safety and quality standards.
